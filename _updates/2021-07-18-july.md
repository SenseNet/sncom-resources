Summer is usually about holiday and relaxation. We are finally able to breathe more freely after a year of quarantine and isolation, but we have not stopped working completely. Here are the features we added and changes we made:

## sn-editor-react@0.2.0

Our richtext editor uses lazy-loading from now on: [1355](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1355)

It works with localiztaion resources (english and hungarian is available) [1351](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1351)

Has a new feature: table insertion and editing 🎉 [1371](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1371)

## gatsby-source-sensenet@0.1.1 and @sn-blog-gatsby

We have removed the sn-blog-gatsby from our monorepo and placed to an independent github repository as [gatsby-starter-sensenet-blog](https://github.com/SenseNet/gatsby-starter-sensenet-blog). We had some bugfixes on the source plugin as well. [1367](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1367)


❗❗ **We also have really sad news**: 2 of them left the team in this month. 😢🎈

We will miss you guys: [Aniko](https://github.com/herflis) & [Zoli](https://github.com/taki9). We wish you all the best in the future!⭐
