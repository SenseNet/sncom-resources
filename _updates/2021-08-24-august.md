# August 2021

Another month went by, here are the changes what we have done:

## admin-ui@1.23.0
There was a limitation in the picker during copy content: you could not copy a content to its parent content.
Now we removed this limitation. [#1383](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1383)

## sn-editor-react@0.3.0
Due to a change in tiptap renderHtml function only accepts JSONContent type as model parameter.
[#1381](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1381/files#diff-5c341af7d323e6fca2a41a871765e2dc47a1432d4e72cbbeadee2b35d799ed62)


See you in next month! ðŸŽ†
