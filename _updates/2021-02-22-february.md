## Valentine's Day 2021 💖💘

Love Is In The Air 🎵 

Everywhere I look around 💏

Love Is In The Air ☁️ 

Every sight and every sound.. 🎶


Another Valentine's day passed by, and we are here with the news. 
Check out what we done during these loving days. 


### admin-ui@1.17.0

We completely renewed our search menu. Now we have advanced options for searching to make this feature easy to use. 💬 [#1180](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1180)

New options:  ⚡
- search by type (document, image, event, user, article, workspace, folder, task, memo, group)
- search in dedicated container
- search for the contents what belongs to me
- search by creation or modification date

Note: This search input does not support query syntax, for queries use the command palette instead! 🌀

Saving queries does not change, you can still store your search filters. 💾
