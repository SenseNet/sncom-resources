## Packages
### [Automatic data and index installation in sensenet](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/auto-install-data)

In this release we started to work on enabling more scenarios for sensenet. In the last year or so we focused mainly on our service offering (sensenet as a service). Now it is time to let developers install a [standalone version of sensenet](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1512), independently from our service infrastructure. To enable this we started to add features and enhancements to make the install process easier and more modern.

#### Features
- [Automatic data install](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1530): this is a step toward a fully automatic self-contained install package inside a web application.
- [Automatic index creation](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1537): if the index is not present when the repository starts, we automatically create it be re-indexing the database. This helps with installing sensenet more easily.

#### Bug fixes
- The install package compress PS script runs correctly in a [Linux environment](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1541).

#### Testing and infrastructure
- In this release we updated the [security infrastructure](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-security/issues/40) to use instances instead of a static API.
- We moved a couple of infratructure actions from the SNaaS code base to the core product to let our admin user interface access them.

### [Security context in a service container](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-security/releases/tag/security-context-di)

This release contains under-the-hood refactors to modernize the security module. 

#### Features
- We converted the [main security api](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-security/issues/40) to work as an instance instead of being static.

### [Search service and GRPC client](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-search-lucene29/releases/tag/search-service-di)

In this release we focused on polishing the search service and converting the remaining Lucene implementations to services that can be registered in DI.
