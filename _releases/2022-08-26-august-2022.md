## Packages
### [Introducing Regex and OpenApi](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/regex-openapi)
In this release we added some new exciting enterprise features, fixed a huge number of bugs and added features that will support the standalone working mode in sensenet.

#### Features
- We introduced [Regex queries](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1685). This is an extension of the current Lucene query language and available everywhere when you execute a sensenet query.
- We introduced an _experimental_ [OpenApi](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1643) implementation for content CRUD operations.
- From now on it is possible to [download index documents](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1686) through the REST API. This lets developers examine the index more closely when searching for issues.

#### Bug fixes
- We added a [more informative](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1644) error message to field update cases.
- Settings content files are [not cached on the client](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1710) anymore to avoid reverting back to an older version on admin UI.
- [Indexing localized values](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1709) and [setting indexing info](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1725) during import is fixed.
- The [incremental naming](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1708) error is fixed.
- [Wildcard expression lowercase issue](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1714) in a LINQ for sensenet environment is fixed.
- It is possible to fetch the [Checked out to field](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client/issues/1411) of a settings content correctly.
- Content type definition [Description is localized](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1733) and indexed correctly.
- Prevent users from setting their [birth dates in the future](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client/issues/1290).
- Uploading an [empty file](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client/issues/1413) on top of an existing file is possible through the REST API. Admin UI (client-side) fix is coming in a later release.

#### Testing and infrastructure
- We continued [refactoring](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1650) our storage configuration to use the new service API.
- Several providers [have been refactored](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1659) to use the new DI api.
- [ISnService](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1647) and [tracer](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1681) instances, [Binary provider](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1653), [OData operation inspector](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1651) and the [indexing activity feature](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1652) also use the new DI api.
- We continued our efforts towards a [standalone sensenet install package](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1513) that developers can use in a container environment.
