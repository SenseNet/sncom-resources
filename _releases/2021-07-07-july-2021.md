## Packages
### [sensenet Statistics](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/statistics-feature)

This release contains a few new features and improvements to support the sensenet service infrastructure.

#### Features
- Introducing the new [statistics](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1459) feature: it lets us track the number of web requests, sent webhooks and a couple of similar events so that administrators have a better understanding of the behavior of the repository.

#### Testing and infrastructure
- We have updated `Microsoft.Extensions` and task management package references, you may need to do the same in your project to be compatible with this release.
- We also removed the `Preview` package dependency from core sensenet libraries.
- We continue to refactor our internal APIs to support a service infrastructure. This time we modernized the [schema and node type system](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1469) to work as instances.

### [sensenet Preview and Controller](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-preview/releases/tag/preview-2021-07-07)
This is a technical release to support the latest sensenet packages.
