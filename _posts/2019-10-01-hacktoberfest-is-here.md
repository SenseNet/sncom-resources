Open source and community are key for us since the beginning of product development at Sense/Net. Our company is very committed to support the movement with helping developers expanding their skill set and make the community bigger and bigger, not just around sensenet, but globally.

This year we want to take it to the next level and increase participation in our project by encouraging developers to contribute. The first 100 participants who makes a pull request to any of the repositories under the Sense/Net organization on GitHub between October 1 and October 31 will receive a sensenet #hacktoberfest limited edition T-shirt.

## How to participate

- Register for the event on the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register).
- Share your contact details with us via [this form](https://www.sensenet.com/Hacktoberfest2019) so we will know where to send your t-shirt when Hacktoberfest ends.
- Make at least one pull-request in one of the repositories under the Sense/Net organization. Note that contributions don’t have to come in the form of code. Improving documentation is also a great place to start.

Since we keep and manage our backlog on github, you can run through the possible tasks easy. Not just the source code but all the documentation and even this blog post is stored under one of our public github repositories so feel free to discover them. Any contributions are welcome no contribution is too small. To make the process smoother we marked couple of our already existing issues with the ```hacktoberfest``` label. Exploring [the list of these labelled issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asensenet+label%3A%22hacktoberfest%22&type=Issues&label=hacktoberfest&utf8=%E2%9C%93) could be a good starting point.

While you only need to make one pull request to receive a shirt, you're welcome to make as many as you like. Our repositories are written with various different languages or frameworks (C#, TypeScript, ASP, React, etc.) so you can easily find your match.  

Come and join our celebration! Our team is eager to hear your feedback and we will do our best to make your contribution a success.

🔥 Happy Hacktoberfest! 🔥
