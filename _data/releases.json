Download the patch from the assets list above.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- The backend part of the [Sharing](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/519) feature provides the API for managing private and public content sharing.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n- [Add allowed child types](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/512) API works correctly.\r\n- Querying on a content's [reference field](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/515) (inner or nested query) works correctly through the OData API.\r\n- User [Avatar property](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/507) always contains the image url and it can be modified correctly.\r\n- Notify property changed event is [fired correctly](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/496) to avoid deviations between the node and content layers.\r\n- Indexing activity [deserialization errors](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/524) are written to the log only once, not every time the same error occurs.\r\n\r\n## Package changes to support .Net Standard\r\n- The legacy _Performance counters api_ [has been removed](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/434) from the core product in preparation for moving our packages to .Net Standard. The feature has been moved to the [Performance counters](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-logging-performancecounters) repo and package.\r\n- We moved the [MSMQ Channel Provider](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/433) to a separate package because the MSMQ technology is not available in .Net Standard.\r\n- We rearranged default permissions for the [Identified and Everyone groups](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/485). This will make adding new users simpler because they will receive the necessary basic permissions automatically through the _Everyone_ group. These changes will affect **new projects only**, they are not included in the upgrade patch to avoid unwanted permission changes.\r\n- We removed the [System.Web reference](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/435) from the Storage library to be able to convert it to .Net Standard later.\r\n- We also removed the [IHttpHandler](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/550) interface from the repository project: Images are served through the regular binary provider from now on.\r\n- We removed the [separate Configuration dll](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/538) from the main package and moved all its classes to the Services library to make our library set more streamlined.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet from NuGet article](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/install-sn-from-nuget).",

Because of this bug developers needed to reload content objects in some cases after a save operation.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n- we extended the built-in OAuth identity with an [avatar image](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-oauth-google/issues/1) so that external providers may import a profile image for the user.\r\n\r\n## Package changes to support .Net Standard\r\n- removed _Entity Framework 6_ [hard reference](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/376): this will let us convert our libraries to .Net Standard later. In the default package there is still an EF6 soft dependency (because of the security component) but that will be also replaced later with the already published [EF Core data provider](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-security/releases/tag/v3.0) for the security component.   \r\n- removed _Ionic.Zip_ [dependency](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/390) from sensenet to rely on the built-in .Net compression API.\r\n- removed _System.Web.Caching_ [dependency](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/465). This **may cause a breaking change** in your project if you used the **cache dependency API** in sensenet. Do not worry, the upgrade is straightforward and very few projects are actually affected.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet from NuGet article](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/install-sn-from-nuget).",

This will make the upgrade from sensenet version 6 to 7 much faster.\r\n   - new control flow step: _WhileDatabaseValue_ will let developers execute long-running db patch operations in blocks without experiencing SQL timeout.\r\n   - DeleteContentType step is able to work with multiple content types to run faster.\r\n- [Version poperties](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/442) are available on the OData API.

        "body": "This is an important milestone toward cloud compatibility: we started to convert our projects to support [.Net Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard). This means that we had to upgrade all our projects to at least _.Net Framework 4.6.1_ (which is the earliest version of the framework that supports netstandard 2.0). \r\n\r\nIn this release cycle we converted the following related packages to .Net Standard:\r\n- SenseNet.Common\r\n- SenseNet.Search\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- [Easy release](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/379): from the next release it will be possible to update only the NuGet package of a component (without executing an upgrade patch) if there were no database or configuration changes (this is not the case for this particular release however, because there are config changes).\r\n- We [removed Unity containers](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/387) from the product in preparation for removing EntLib as a dependency. Please check remaining Unity containers and type definitions in your configuration after upgrading.\r\n- Our provider loading mechanism got smarter: if there is no provider configured _in code_ for a certain name, it will look into the configuration file for that provider automatically.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n- There was a [stackoverflow exception](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/393) in certain cases when a custom Membership extender tried to access the security subsystem.\r\n- There was a [serialization error](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/404) during patch execution (when upgrading from a previous version), caused by an incorrect indexing algorithm.\r\n- [Incorrectly formatted xml](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/322) files were not indexed at all. From now on we index them as regular text files.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n- Please make sure that all your projects are built using .Net Framework 4.6.1 (or a later version) before upgrading.\r\n- Please check remaining Unity containers and type definitions in your configuration after upgrading.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet from NuGet article](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/install-sn-from-nuget).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade from previous version\r\nIf you already have sensenet installed and want an **in-place upgrade** instead of re-creating the database, please run the **upgrade patch** (you'll find it above in the **Assets** list) in your dev, test and live environments to be up to date.

In this first phase nothing will actually change architecturally: the index folders will remain in the local web directory as before. But under the hood we decoupled the search module from the repository, which means we will be able to create and deploy a separate search service in the future, without changing the code in the main application.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\nThis version contains **API changes** that *may* break low-level search-related calls. We had to move a few classes to a different namespace (e.g. the base *TextExecutor* class) and a few enumerations too. If you encounter build or type load errors during or after the upgrade, please follow the suggestions in Visual Studio to update those calls or base classes. We do not expect to have many of these, but if you stuck with the upgrade please contact us for help.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n- [SmtpClient instances](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/290) are created in a using block so that they got desposed properly to prevent connection leak.\r\n- [Logout action](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/295) can be called without providing the *ultimateLogout* optional parameter.\r\n- [Add initial *See* permission](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/248) for the *Identified Users* group to the Folder content type so that users see the folder creator action on the UI.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet ECM from NuGet article](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/install-sn-from-nuget).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade from previous version\r\nIf you already have sensenet ECM installed and want an **in-place upgrade** instead of re-creating the database, please run the **upgrade patch** (you'll find it above in the **Assets** list) in your dev, test and live environments to be up to date.
