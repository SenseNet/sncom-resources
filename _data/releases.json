This is a generic step so you'll be able to use it in similar scenarios.\r\n   - We [extended](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/362) the _ForEach_ SnAdmin step to work with an explicit file list (e.g. well-known config files) in a loop.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet from NuGet article](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/install-sn-from-nuget).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade from previous version\r\nIf you already have sensenet installed and want an **in-place upgrade** instead of re-creating the database, please run the **upgrade patch** (you'll find it above in the **Assets** list) in your dev, test and live environments to be up to date.

If a LINQ method is not supported, we throw a meaningful exception to inform the developer what to do.\r\n- Fixed a [wildcard query bug](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/348) in LINQ to SN that broke _StartsWith_ expressions.\r\n- When the user Profiles container is created, we set container permissions [correctly](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/159) so that new users can access their profiles.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet from NuGet article](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/install-sn-from-nuget).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade from previous version\r\nIf you already have sensenet installed and want an **in-place upgrade** instead of re-creating the database, please run the **upgrade patch** (you'll find it above in the **Assets** list) in your dev, test and live environments to be up to date.

        "body": "## New features\r\n### Search module\r\nThis is a [major update](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/125) of the platform: we generalized indexing and querying so that the *Lucene* search engine can be refactored later to work as a *service* instead of as a *local index*. In this first phase nothing will actually change architecturally: the index folders will remain in the local web directory as before. But under the hood we decoupled the search module from the repository, which means we will be able to create and deploy a separate search service in the future, without changing the code in the main application.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\nThis version contains **API changes** that *may* break low-level search-related calls. We had to move a few classes to a different namespace (e.g. the base *TextExecutor* class) and a few enumerations too. If you encounter build or type load errors during or after the upgrade, please follow the suggestions in Visual Studio to update those calls or base classes. We do not expect to have many of these, but if you stuck with the upgrade please contact us for help.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n- [SmtpClient instances](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/290) are created in a using block so that they got desposed properly to prevent connection leak.\r\n- [Logout action](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/295) can be called without providing the *ultimateLogout* optional parameter.\r\n- [Add initial *See* permission](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/248) for the *Identified Users* group to the Folder content type so that users see the folder creator action on the UI.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet ECM from NuGet article](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/install-sn-from-nuget).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade from previous version\r\nIf you already have sensenet ECM installed and want an **in-place upgrade** instead of re-creating the database, please run the **upgrade patch** (you'll find it above in the **Assets** list) in your dev, test and live environments to be up to date.

This makes OData responses more robust.\r\n- Eliminated several null reference errors when there was no Site content in the system.\r\n- Install logic can deal with existing databases.\r\n- Service action generates a correct url even if the service name starts with a slash.\r\n- Saving the Root content is possible.\r\n- Removed unnecessary custom workspace type references from the User ctd that prevented saving users.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n### Packaging\r\nPackage manifest structure had to be changed to support the new component model of sensenet ECM. \r\n- Every manifest should contain a component Id and optionally a list of dependent components.\r\n- Package type definition has been simplified.\r\n- Old package structure is not supported anymore, manifest files have to be upgraded.\r\nSee the new manifest structure in this article: [SnAdmin](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-admin/blob/master/docs/SnAdmin.md)\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n- Open in Office feature is currently not available ([issue #10](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/10)).\r\n- Windows authentication is currently not available ([issue #69](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/69)).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet ECM from NuGet article](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/blob/master/docs/install-sn-from-nuget.md).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade from previous versions\r\nIf you installed a previous version, please export your custom content **before you get the new version**:\r\n1. export your custom content from the Content Repository (using the export [SnAdmin tool](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/blob/master/docs/snadmin-tools.md))\r\n2. uninstall the previous NuGet package (v7.0.0 beta)\r\n3. install the new package (v7.0.0 beta2)\r\n4. reinstall the whole Services component.

Please follow the instructions in the [Getting started section](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet#GettingStarted) of the main readme.\r\n\r\n[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SenseNet.Services.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SenseNet.Services)\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\nThere are a couple of known issues with the beta release. We plan to solve these before releasing the stable version:\r\n\r\n- Open in Office feature is [currently not available](/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/10) in the beta release.\r\n- There is a single Services NuGet package that contains _both dlls and install content files_. If you install the package into _multiple projects_, all the install files (e.g. web.config additions) will be added to all those projects. In the future we will publish two different NuGet packages: one containing only dlls and one for install files.",
